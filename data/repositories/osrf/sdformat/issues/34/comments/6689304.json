Make it so sdformat doesn't depend on boost at all. You've provided a link to Erwin's stripped down version of boost as an idea for how to retain the functionality.\n\n2. Use boost internally, but make it so downstream software that uses sdformat doesn't have to depend on boost, so that there are no boost references in any header files for example. This way if they have the sdformat deb installed, then they don't need to compile against bullet.\n\nWhich one are you proposing?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I can think of two different goals here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make it so sdformat doesn't depend on boost at all.
