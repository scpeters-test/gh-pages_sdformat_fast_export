How is this \"joint frame\" defined? where is the origin of this joint frame?\r\n\r\nIn version 1.6 the [documentation for <pose>](http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=joint#joint_pose) does not state the default when the `<pose>` itself or the `<frame>` in which this pose is measured, are not specified.\r\nHowever, [version 1.4 doc](http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.4&elem=joint#joint_pose) does state that the default is the identity transform \"in the child link frame\" (ala urdf, makes sense).\r\n\r\nThe questions are:\r\n\r\n1.
