It's more like an extension to models, so it can also have links and joints. So they're not tied to the animation or skin, they're directly under the `<actor>`. See [this example](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=actor&cat=build_robot#Worldexplained). Whether this is useful is a valid question though. I actually suspect that actor joints are useless, because neither physics nor the animation may be acting on them. We could consider decoupling the scripting of model trajectories from skeleton animation. \n\nSo feel free to leave links and joints out for now while we get skeleton animations to work. Once we have that working, we can revisit the idea of scripting link motions and see if they still fit well within actors.
