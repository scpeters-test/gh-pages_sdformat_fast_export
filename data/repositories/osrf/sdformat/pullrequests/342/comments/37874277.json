I did a brief survey, and other than the Param constructor itself, there are only 3 other methods that call the Param constructor, all in the Element class: AddValue, CreateParam, and AddAttribute.  Of those three, CreateParam() is a private method, which we don't document.  The other two are public methods, but doing try/catch doesn't seem to make much sense for either.  In AddValue(), we want to create the parameter to store it in the value object; if it doesn't create, I don't think we necessarily want to add an empty/null object.  Similarly with AddAttribute(), we want to create the parameter to store it in the vector of attributes, but again I don't think we want to add an empty/null object to that list.  So I ended up just documenting that they can throw an exception now.  Let me know what you think.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Good idea.
