I didn't even think of doing things that way :).  Thanks.  Now I think I understand what is probably going on here.  In this PR, I added the NullDoc test, but Assert.hh is still using BOOST_ASSERT_MSG.  Depending on how Boost was compiled, BOOST_ASSERT_MSG could be a no-op, which is what I'm guessing happened on Windows.  In PR 5/5, I actually change away from using BOOST_ASSERT_MSG to using our own home-grown message.  So I think the answer here is to remove this test from this PR, and add it to PR 5/5 instead.  That should fix this up.  Thanks again for your help in solving this!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Oh, interesting find.  I didn't even think of doing things that way :).  Thanks.
