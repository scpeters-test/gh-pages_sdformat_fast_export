Similarly, extra resource files are installed in a single version manner (e.g., all packages of libsdformat install to same directory: /usr/share/sdformat). The upshot is that different package versions cannot be installed on the same system.\r\n\r\nIt seems it would be better to follow a similar pattern to projects like python. So assuming that incompatibilities of libraries occur at major versions then:\r\n- package names stay as they currently are: e.g. libsdformat3\r\n- include directories have the major version number: e.g., /usr/include/sdformat3.\r\n- library name includes the major version number: e.g., /usr/lib/libsdformat3.so, and are sym linked to the full version numbers: e.g., libsformat3.so -> libformat3.so.3, and libformat3.so.3.0.0.\r\n- extra resource also include the major version number: e.g., /usr/share/sdformat3.\r\n\r\nThis is not what I have done in this pull request. But I think would be a more consistent and flexible build strategy that could be adopted throughout gazebo and its associated libraries.", "title": "More flexible build allowing for multi-version installation.", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "e5104282e829", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/sdformat/commit/e5104282e829.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/sdformat/commits/e5104282e829"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/sdformat.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/sdformat"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{b6d52f9f-b070-41c0-807c-94af07ea375b}ts=1606789"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "sdformat", "full_name": "osrf/sdformat", "uuid": "{b6d52f9f-b070-41c0-807c-94af07ea375b}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "7fad912b0471", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/daveraja/sdformat/commit/7fad912b0471"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/daveraja/sdformat/commits/7fad912b0471"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/daveraja/sdformat"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/daveraja/sdformat"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{8e3ddb1b-2624-47fa-ab35-1b0f72ea81aa}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "sdformat", "full_name": "daveraja/sdformat", "uuid": "{8e3ddb1b-2624-47fa-ab35-1b0f72ea81aa}"}, "branch": {"name": "configurable_library_name"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "David Rajaratnam", "uuid": "{fd1ab40d-0066-4f24-a9cf-f0d31e2f3b94}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bfd1ab40d-0066-4f24-a9cf-f0d31e2f3b94%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Bfd1ab40d-0066-4f24-a9cf-f0d31e2f3b94%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0606003bcb8fedcc1f6e5b0e35a76d3ed=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsDR-1.png"}}, "nickname": "daveraja", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:0e570377-5e6f-4dc1-bf90-f8da9be9e584"}, "date": "2017-03-17T01:17:45.247893+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 326, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/sdformat/pullrequests/326.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/sdformat/pull-requests/326"}}, "title": "More flexible build allowing for multi-version installation."}}]}
